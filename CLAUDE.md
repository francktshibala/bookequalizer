# BookEqualizer - B2B Educational Reading Platform

## üéØ Project Focus
**Target Market**: B2B Education (Schools, Districts, Educational Institutions)  
**Core Value**: Teacher-first classroom management with AI-powered reading assistance and real-time text-audio synchronization  
**Revenue Goal**: $100K ARR through school/district licensing  
**Primary Pain Point**: Reading intervention programs cost schools $10K-100K/year with insufficient teacher training support

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
**Ultra-Simplified Stack**:
- Monolithic Next.js 14.2.8 with API routes (no separate Express backend)
- Single PostgreSQL database with Supabase
- One Python AI service for text processing
- Clerk authentication with classroom organization
- Deployment: Vercel + Supabase only

## üìö Key Features (Teacher-First Design)
**For Teachers (Primary Users)**:
- **Classroom Overview Dashboard** - 20-30 students at-a-glance with reading levels and alerts
- **Bulk Assignment System** - Assign content to student groups efficiently  
- **Intervention Alerts** - Immediately highlight struggling readers
- **Progress Analytics** - Visual dashboards showing reading improvement trends
- **Parent Communication** - Auto-generated progress reports
- **Google Books Integration** - Access to 10M+ educational titles

**For Students (Simplified Interface)**:
- Large "Start Reading" button with minimal navigation
- Real-time text-audio synchronization (<50ms delay)
- AI-powered Q&A for comprehension ("Ask Teacher" backup)
- Always-visible progress tracking
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility features

**For Administrators**:
- School/district usage analytics
- FERPA/COPPA compliance documentation
- License management and ROI reporting

## üéØ Implementation Plan (4 Weeks - Teacher-First MVP)

### Week 1: Teacher Dashboard Foundation
- [ ] Teacher authentication with Clerk (classroom organization)
- [ ] Classroom overview dashboard (student list, reading levels)
- [ ] Basic database schema for schools/classrooms/students
- [ ] Google Books API integration for content library

### Week 2: Assignment & Content Management  
- [ ] Bulk assignment system (assign books to student groups)
- [ ] Content upload (PDF support + Google Books)
- [ ] Student invitation/enrollment system
- [ ] Teacher content library management

### Week 3: Student Reading Experience
- [ ] Simplified student interface (large "Start Reading" button)
- [ ] Real-time text-audio synchronization
- [ ] AI-powered Q&A system
- [ ] Basic progress tracking (time spent, pages read)

### Week 4: Analytics & Pilot Preparation
- [ ] Teacher progress analytics dashboard
- [ ] Intervention alerts for struggling readers
- [ ] FERPA compliance documentation
- [ ] Deploy pilot version for 3 teacher validation calls

## üîß Development Commands  
**Monolithic App**: `npm run dev` (Next.js with API routes)
**Database**: `npm run db:push`  
**Type Check**: `npm run typecheck`  
**Lint**: `npm run lint`  

## üíª Development Standards
**Code Quality**:
- TypeScript strict mode
- Comprehensive error handling
- Input validation with Zod
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

**Performance Targets**:
- Page load: <2 seconds
- AI response: <3 seconds
- Audio sync delay: <50ms

**Security**:
- FERPA/COPPA compliance
- Role-based access control
- Secure document storage
- Input sanitization

## üöÄ B2B Sales Strategy (Research-Driven)
**Key Decision Makers**:
1. **Superintendent** (final authority for $15K+ purchases)
2. **Curriculum Director** (educational alignment & standards compliance)  
3. **Technology Director** (technical feasibility & security)

**Pricing Model**:
- School License: $10K-15K/year (requires superintendent approval)
- District License: $50K-100K/year 
- Pilot Program: 3-month free with full support

**Target Pain Points**:
- Reading intervention costs ($10K-100K/year per school)
- Teacher training requirements (80+ hours for new tools)
- 40% of 4th graders can't read at basic level
- State compliance mandates (CA screening by June 2025)

## üìã Success Metrics
**Week 4 MVP Goals**:
- 3 teacher validation calls completed
- Teacher dashboard functional
- Student reading experience working
- FERPA compliance documentation ready

**30-Day Post-MVP**:
- 3 pilot schools contracted ($30K ARR)
- 50 active teacher accounts
- 500 students using weekly
- 80% teacher satisfaction (reduces prep time)

## üö® Ultra-Simplified Approach
**What We're NOT Doing**:
- Multi-agent development (ONE agent only)
- Separate Express backend (Next.js API routes only)
- Consumer B2C features  
- Complex deployment (Vercel + Supabase only)
- Fancy animations or design

**What We ARE Doing**:
- Teacher-first B2B education platform
- Monolithic Next.js architecture until $100K ARR
- Ship MVP in 4 weeks, not 8
- Validate with teachers before building more features
- Educational UI/UX patterns (clean, professional, boring)

## üé® UI/UX Design System
**Colors**: Navy blue (#1e40af) + Forest green (#059669)
**Typography**: Large, sans-serif fonts for accessibility
**Layout**: Grid-based, mobile-first (teachers use iPads)
**Interactions**: Large touch targets, minimal animations
**Priority**: Teacher workflow efficiency over visual appeal
