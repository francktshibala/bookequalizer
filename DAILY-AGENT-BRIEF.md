# Daily Agent Brief

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Mission
Build BookEqualizer B2B education platform. Transform this from consumer audiobook app to school reading assistant.

```bash
git pull origin main
npm run dev                # Start backend
cd frontend && npm run dev # Start frontend (separate terminal)
```

### Your Checklist:
- [ ] Read CLAUDE.md and TODO.md

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus
**Building for schools, not consumers**:
