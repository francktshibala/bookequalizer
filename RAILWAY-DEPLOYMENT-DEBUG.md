# Railway Deployment Debug Log

## üö® Current Status: BLOCKED
**Issue**: Railway deployment consistently returns 404 "Application not found"  
**Service URL**: https://bookequalizer-ai-production.up.railway.app  
**Railway Project**: bookequalizer-ai (1c1df341-d15d-47bf-a9ca-035adec1846c)  

## üîß Attempts Made

### 1. Created Minimal FastAPI Service
- **File**: `/home/franc/bookequalizer/ai-service/main.py` (ultra-minimal version)
- **Dependencies**: Only `fastapi==0.104.1` and `uvicorn[standard]==0.24.0`
- **Result**: 404 error persists

### 2. Fixed Requirements Dependencies
- **Original**: 21 heavy ML dependencies (spacy, langchain, etc.)
- **Minimal**: Reduced to 2 core dependencies
- **Files**: `requirements-minimal.txt`, `requirements-test.txt`
- **Result**: Still failing

### 3. Corrected Main.py Reference
- **Issue**: Fixed `"main-minimal:app"` to `"main:app"` in uvicorn.run()
- **Result**: No change in deployment behavior

### 4. Railway Configuration Tests
- **With railway.yml**: Used custom build/start commands
- **Without railway.yml**: Tried Railway's automatic detection
- **Result**: Both approaches failed

### 5. Multiple Deployment Attempts
- **Commands tried**: `railway up`, `railway up --detach`
- **Total deployments**: 6+ attempts
- **Result**: All return same 404 error

## üîç Key Observations

1. **Railway CLI Response**: `railway up` succeeds with build logs URL
2. **Domain Exists**: `railway domain` confirms URL is active
3. **SSL/TLS Works**: Curl connects successfully to Railway's edge servers
4. **404 from Railway Edge**: Error comes from `railway-edge` server, not app
5. **No Deployment Logs**: `railway logs` returns "No deployments found"

## üí° Next Steps & Suggestions

### Immediate Actions Needed:
1. **Check Railway Dashboard**: Access web interface to see actual build logs
2. **Verify Project Linking**: Ensure `railway link` is properly configured
3. **Test Local Build**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt && python main.py` locally
4. **Check Railway Service**: May need to create new service or fix existing one

### Debugging Commands:
```bash
# Check Railway status
railway whoami
railway status
railway list

# Try manual service creation
railway add
railway service

# Check environment
railway variables
```

### Alternative Approaches:
1. **Create New Railway Service**: Current service may be corrupted
2. **Use Dockerfile**: Instead of nixpacks auto-detection
3. **Test on Different Platform**: Try Heroku/Render as backup
4. **Check Railway Limits**: Verify account isn't hitting limits

## üìÅ Files Modified/Created

### Core Files:
- `ai-service/main.py` - Ultra-minimal FastAPI (current)
- `ai-service/requirements.txt` - Minimal dependencies (current)
- `ai-service/main-minimal.py` - Backup minimal version
- `ai-service/requirements-minimal.txt` - Backup minimal deps
- `ai-service/test.py` - Ultra-minimal test version
- `ai-service/railway.yml.bak` - Backup of Railway config

### Current Working Files:
```python
# main.py (current)
from fastapi import FastAPI
import uvicorn
import os

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def root():
    return {"message": "Hello Railway!"}

@app.get("/health")
def health():
    return {"status": "ok"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 8000))
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=port)
```

```txt
# requirements.txt (current)
fastapi==0.104.1
uvicorn[standard]==0.24.0
```

## üö® Root Cause Analysis

**Most Likely Issue**: Railway service configuration problem
- Deployments are uploading but not starting
- Edge server returns 404 suggesting app isn't running
- Build logs URL works but logs not accessible via CLI

**Next Agent Should**:
1. Access Railway dashboard directly via web browser
2. Check if new service needs to be created
3. Verify Railway project is properly linked
4. Test local deployment first to ensure code works

## üìû Handoff Context

**Current Directory**: `/home/franc/bookequalizer/ai-service/`
**Railway Project**: `bookequalizer-ai` 
**Status**: Deployment failing at Railway service level, not code level
**Priority**: HIGH - blocking frontend deployment

**Key Files to Check**:
- `RAILWAY-DEPLOYMENT-DEBUG.md` (this file)
- `ai-service/main.py` (current minimal version)
- `ai-service/requirements.txt` (current minimal deps)
- `DEPLOYMENT-PLAN.md` (original plan)
